# Choose the Best Distribution Style
    1.	Distribute the fact table and one dimension table on their common columns.
    2.	Choose the largest dimension based on the size of the filtered data set.
    3.	Choose a column with high cardinality in the filtered result set.
    4.	Change some dimension tables to use ALL distribution.
